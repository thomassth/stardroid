# Telescope.Touch: the definitive mobile planetarium

Telescope.Touch was born as an attempt of merging [Sky Map](https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid) and
[IPARCOS](https://github.com/INDIForJava/IPARCOS), an INDI client for Android. It features full telescope control
and mobile sky chart functionality, with a completely renewed user interface and base code.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcocipriani01/Telescope.Touch)
